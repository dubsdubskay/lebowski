1,The Dude,"  Nobody calls me Lebowski. You got the wrong guy. I'm The Dude, man."
2,Blond Treehorn Thug," Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski - Your wife is Bunny."
3,The Dude," My ... my wi- my wife, Bunny? Do you see a wedding ring on my finger? Does this place look like I'm fucking married? The toilet seat's up, man!"
4,The Dude," ..Yeah, man, it really tied the room together."
5,Walter Sobchak," Were you listening to The Dude's story, Donny?"
6,Walter Sobchak, Were you listening to The Dude's story?
7,Walter Sobchak," So you have no frame of reference here, Donny. You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to know -"
8,The Dude," Walter, Walter, what's the point, man?"
9,Walter Sobchak," There's no reason - Here's my point, Dude. There's no fucking reason why these two -"
10,Donny," Yeah, Walter, what's your point?"
11,Walter Sobchak," Huh? No, what the fuck are you …! I'm not ... we're talking about unchecked aggression here, Dude."
12,Donny, What the fuck is he talking about?
13,Walter Sobchak," Forget it, Donny, you're out of your element!"
14,The Dude," Look, Walter - Walter, the Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill, so what the fuck are you talking about?"
15,Walter Sobchak," What the fuck are you talking about? The Chinaman is not the issue here, Dude! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line, you do not... Also, Dude, ""Chinaman"" is not the preferred nomenclature. ""Asian-American,"" please."
16,The Dude," Walter, this isn't a guy who built the railroads here. This is a guy..."
17,The Dude," Walter, he peed on my rug!"
18,Donny, He peed on the Dude's rug.
19,Walter Sobchak," Donny, you're out of your element! Dude, the Chinaman is not the issue here!"
20,Walter Sobchak," Jeff Lebowski, the other Jeffery Lebowski. The millionaire!"
21,The Dude," That's fucking interesting, man. That's fucking interesting."
22,Walter Sobchak," Plus, he has the wealth, obviously, and the resources. So that there's no reason - there's no FUCKING reason - why his wife should go out and owe money all over town, and then they come, and they pee on your fucking rug! Am I wrong?"
23,Bunny Lebowski,  I'll suck your cock for a thousand dollars.
24,Brandt," Ah-hahahahaha! Ah - Wonderful woman. We're all, we're all very fond of her. Very free-spirited."
25,Bunny Lebowski," Brandt can't watch, though - or he has to pay a hundred."
26,The Dude,"  ..Uh, I'm just gonna go find a cash machine."
27,Walter Sobchak, Fucking dog has fucking papers -OVER THE LINE!
28,Walter Sobchak," I'm sorry, Smokey. You were over the line, that's a foul."
29,Smokey," Bullshit. Mark it 8, Dude."
30,Walter Sobchak," Uh, excuse me. Mark it zero. Next frame."
31,Walter Sobchak," Smokey, this is not 'Nam. This is bowling. There are rules."
32,The Dude," Hey, Walter, c'mon, it's just - Hey man, it's Smokey. So his toe slipped over a little, you know, it's just a game, man."
33,Walter Sobchak," This is a league game, this determines who enters the next round robin. Am I wrong?"
34,Smokey," Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the marker Dude, I'm marking an 8."
35,Walter Sobchak," Smokey, my friend,  you're entering a world of pain."
36,Walter Sobchak," You mark that frame an 8, you're entering a world of pain."
37,Walter Sobchak, A world of pain.
38,Smokey," Look, Dude, I - This is your partner..."
39,Walter Sobchak,  Has the whole world gone CRAZY?!  AM I THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT THE RULES?! MARK IT ZERO!
40,The Dude," They're calling the cops, man. Put the piece away. "
41,Walter Sobchak, MARK IT ZERO! 
42,Walter Sobchak,  YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?!  MARK IT ZERO! 
43,Smokey,"  All right, it's fucking zero. Are you happy, you crazy fuck?"
44,Walter Sobchak,"  It's a league game, Smokey."
45,Walter Sobchak," You know, Dude, I myself dabbled in pacifism once. Not in 'Nam of course."
46,The Dude," And, you know, he's got emotional problems, man."
47,Walter Sobchak, You mean ... beyond pacifism?
48,The Dude," Fuckin' Quintana , that creep can roll, man."
49,Walter Sobchak," Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude."
50,Walter Sobchak," No! He's a sex offender, with a record - He served 6 months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight year old."
51,Walter Sobchak," When he moved to Hollywood, he had to go door to door to tell everyone he was a pederast."
52,Donny," What's a pederast, Walter?"
53,Walter Sobchak," Shut the fuck up, Donny."
54,The Dude, She probably kidnapped herself.
55,The Dude," Rug Peers did not do this - Look at it! A young trophy wife, marries this guy for his money.. she figures he isn't given her enough, you know, she owes money all over town..."
56,Walter Sobchak, That fucking bitch.
57,The Dude," It's all a goddamn fake, man! It's like Lenin said.  You look for the person who will benefit, and, uh, uh, you know"
58,Donny," ""I am the walrus""?"
59,The Dude, You know what I'm trying to say?
60,Walter Sobchak, That fucking bitch!
61,Walter Sobchak," That's ex-- Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!"
62,Donny, What the fuck is he talking about?
63,Walter Sobchak, Fuckin' exactly what happened to those... That makes me fuckin' sick!
64,The Dude," Well, what do you care, Walter?"
65,Walter Sobchak," Those rich fucks! This whole fuckin' thing! I did not watch my buddies die face-down in the muck so this fuckin' strumpet, this fuckin' whore could waltz around town-"
66,The Dude," Walter, Walter - I don't see any connection to Vietnam, man."
67,Walter Sobchak," Well it isn't a literal connection, Dude.."
68,The Dude," Walter, face it - There isn't any connection. Your roll."
69,Walter Sobchak," Have it your way, but my point -"
70,Jesus Quintana," Are you ready to be fucked, man?  I see you rolled your way into the semis. Dios mio, man. Liam and me, we're gonna fuck you up!"
71,The Dude," Yeah... well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man."
72,Jesus Quintana," Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes ""click""."
73,The Dude, Jesus.
74,Jesus Quintana," You said it, man. Nobody fucks with The Jesus. "
75,Walter Sobchak," ...  Eight year olds, Dude."
76,Walter Sobchak,"  That wasn't her toe, Dude."
77,The Dude," Whose toe was it, Walter?"
78,Walter Sobchak, How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates...
79,The Dude," The nail polish, Walter!"
80,Walter Sobchak," Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to take some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe..."
81,Walter Sobchak, Pinking shears... 
82,Walter Sobchak," You want a toe? I can get you a toe. Believe me. There are ways, Dude - you don't wanna know about it, believe me."
83,Walter Sobchak," Hell, I can get you a toe by 3:00 this afternoon, with nail polish. These fucking amateurs!  They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit ourselves with fear. Jesus Christ!"
84,The Dude," They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me."
85,Walter Sobchak," Dude... That's... That's just the stress talkin', man. Now so far, we have, what appears to me, to be a series of victimless crimes..."
86,The Dude, What about the toe?!
87,Walter Sobchak,  FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!
88,Waitress at diner,"  Excuse me, sir. Could you please keep your voices down? This is a family restaurant."
89,Walter Sobchak," Oh please, dear? For your information, the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!"
90,The Dude," Walter, this is not a First Amendment thing, man."
91,Waitress at diner," Sir, if you don't calm down, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave."
92,Walter Sobchak," Lady, I got buddies who died face-down in the muck so that you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!"
93,Walter Sobchak,"  Oh come on, Dude... Don't walk away, man! C'mon, this affects all of us, man! Our basic freedoms!  Enjoying my coffee."
94,Cab Driver," Fuck you, man! If you don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!"
95,Cab Driver, I'll pull to the side and kick your ass out.
96,The Dude," Man, come on, I had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man."
97,Donny,  They posted the next round for the tournament!
98,Walter Sobchak," Donny, shut the f... When do we play?"
99,Walter Sobchak," Saturday? Well, they'll have to reschedule."
100,The Dude," Walter, what am I gonna tell Lebowski?"
101,Walter Sobchak," I told that fuck down at the league office, Who's in charge of scheduling?"
102,Walter Sobchak, I told that kraut a fucking thousand times that I don't roll on Shabbos!
103,Walter Sobchak," WELL, THEY CAN FUCKING UNPOST IT!"
104,The Dude," Who gives a shit?! They're gonna kill that poor woman, man! What am I gonna tell Lebowski?"
105,Walter Sobchak," C'mon, Dude - Uh, eventually she'll get tired of her little game and, you know, wander on back."
106,Donny," How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?"
107,Walter Sobchak, I'm Shomer Shabbos.
108,Walter Sobchak," Saturday, Donny, is Shabbos, the Jewish day of rest. That means that I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit DON'T FUCKING ROLL!"
109,Walter Sobchak, SHOMER SHABBOS!
110,Walter Sobchak, Shomer fucking Shabbos.
111,The Dude," Oh, fuck! That's it, I'm outta here."
112,Walter Sobchak," Come on, Dude,   What a fucking baby ."
113,Walter Sobchak, Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
114,Donny," They were Nazis, Dude?"
115,Walter Sobchak," Oh, come on, Donny, they were threatening castration! Are we gonna split hairs here? Am I wrong?"
116,The Dude," Oh, the usual - I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback."
117,Walter Sobchak,"  We're gonna see some tank battles.. Fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle. I mean that was a foot-soldier's war - Whereas this thing here should, uh.. y'know - Should be a piece of cake. I mean, I had an M16 Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Me and Charlie - eyeball to eyeball. That's fucking combat. The man in the black pajamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary."
118,Donny," Who was in pajamas, Walter?"
119,Walter Sobchak," Shut the fuck up, Donny. ..Whereas what we have here.. Bunch of fig-eaters wearin' towels on their head tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank - This.. this is not a worthy fuckin' adversary.."
120,Jesus Quintana," HEY!   What's this ""day of rest"" shit?! What's this BULLSHIT?! I don't fuckin' care! It don't matter to Jesus. But you're not foolin' me, man. You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus. This bush-league psych out stuff. Laughable, man  HA HA! I would have fucked you in the ass Saturday. I fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead. WOOO! You got a date Wednesday, baby! "
121,Walter Sobchak," I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money. My point is, here we are, it's shabbos, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life or death..."
122,The Dude," Will you come off it, Walter? You're not even fucking Jewish, man."
123,Walter Sobchak, What the fuck are you talkin' about?
124,The Dude," Man, you're fucking Polish Catholic..."
125,Walter Sobchak," What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!"
126,Walter Sobchak, And you know this!
127,The Dude," Yeah, and five fucking years ago you were divorced."
128,Walter Sobchak, So what are you saying? When you get divorced you turn in your library card? You get a new license? You stop being Jewish? I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye.
129,The Dude," It's all a part of your sick Cynthia thing, man. Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past."
130,Walter Sobchak," Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax...You're goddamn right I'm living in the fucking past! I'm... Jesus. What the hell happened?"
131,The Dude," You thought that Bunny had been kidnapped and you were fuckin' glad, man. You could use it as an excuse to make some money disappear. All you needed was a sap to pin it on! You'd just met me! You f... You human  paraquat! You figured ""oh, here's a loser"", you know? A deadbeat, someone the square community won't give a shit about."
132,The Stranger," Sure. Take it easy, Dude."
133,The Dude, Oh yeah!
134,The Stranger, I know that you will.
135,The Dude," Yeah, well - The Dude abides."
136,The Stranger," ""The Dude abides."" I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners. Shoosh. I sure hope he makes the finals."
137,Walter Sobchak, Is this your homework Larry? Is this your homework Larry?
138,Walter Sobchak," Dude please, Is this your homework Larry?"
139,The Dude, Just ask him about the car man
140,Walter Sobchak," Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework Larry?"
141,The Dude, We know it's his fucking homework! Where's the money you little brat?!
142,Walter Sobchak," Look, Larry...Have you ever heard of Vietnam?"
143,Walter Sobchak," You're entering a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework, we know you stole the car--"
144,Walter Sobchak, And the fucking money. And..we know this is your homework.
145,The Dude," They're gonna cut your dick off, Larry!"
146,Walter Sobchak," You're killing your father, Larry!"
147,Da Fino," Easy man, relax. No physical harm intended."
148,The Dude," Who the fuck are you, man?"
149,The Dude, Why are you following me around? Come on fuckhead!
150,Da Fino," Hey, relax man. I'm a Brother Shamus."
151,The Dude, Brother Shamus? Like an Irish monk?
152,Da Fino," What the fuck are you talking about? My name's Da Fino. I'm a private snoop. Like you, man."
153,The Dude, I'm not-- Just stay away from my special lady friend.
154,Da Fino," Hey hey, i'm not messing with your special lady."
155,The Dude," She's not my special lady. She's my fucking lady friend-- I'm just trying to help her conceive, man."
156,The Dude, Who're you working for? Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
157,The Dude, The?-- Who the fuck are the Knutsens?
158,Da Fino," The Knutsens. It's a wandering daughter job. Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Knutsen, she ran away from home. Her parents want her back.  See. Crazy, huh? Ran away about a year ago. The Knutsens told me I should show her this when I found her. It's the family farm. It's outside of Moorhead, Minnesota. They think it'll make her homesick."
159,The Dude, Jesus fucking Christ. She's been kidnapped Da Fino.
160,Da Fino," Hey, uh, phfff, maybe you and me could pool our resources, trade information... a professional courtesy...compeers, you know what i mean."
161,The Dude," Yeah yeah, I get it. Fuck off, Da Fino. And stay away from my special--from my fucking lady friend man."
162,The Dude,"Well, sir, it's this rug I had. It really tied the room together."
163,The Dude,"Look, let me explain something to you. I'm not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. That, or His Dudeness, Duder  or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing."
164,The Dude,"This is a very complicated case, Maude. You know, a lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-you's. And, uh, lotta strands to keep in my head, man. Lotta strands in old Duder's head. Luckily I'm adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber."
165,The Dude,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man."
166,The Dude,"Careful, man, there's a beverage here!"
167,The Dude,"Oh boy, how you gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they've seen Karl Hungus."
168,The Dude,"Well, you know, the Dude abides."
169,The Dude,"Obviously, you're not a golfer."
170,The Dude,"Oh, nice marmot."
171,Walter Sobchak,"Nihilists! ..Fuck me. I mean, say what you want about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos."
172,Walter Sobchak,"That rug really tied the room together, did it not?"
173,Walter Sobchak,"Fuck it, Dude. Let's go bowling."
174,Walter Sobchak,"Life does not start and stop at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit!"
175,Walter Sobchak,"Shut the fuck up, Donny."
176,Walter Sobchak,"Forget it, Donny, you're out of your element!"
177,Walter Sobchak,"Is this your homework, Larry?"
178,Walter Sobchak,Language problem here. Little prick stonewalling me...!
179,Walter Sobchak,Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
180,Walter Sobchak,You want a toe? I can get you a toe.
181,Walter Sobchak,"Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors... and bowling, and as a surfer he explored the beaches of Southern California, from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo and... up to... Pismo. He died, like so many young men of his generation, he died before his time. In your wisdom, Lord, you took him, as you took so many bright flowering young men at Khe Sanh, at Langdok, at Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And so would Donny. Donny, who loved bowling. And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. Good night, sweet prince."
182,Walter Sobchak,Who am I? I'm a fucking veteran that's who I am!
183,Jesus Quintana,"HEY! What's this day of rest shit?! What's this bullshit?! I don't fuckin' care! It don't matter to Jesus. But you're not foolin' me, man. You might fool the fucks in the league office, but you don't fool Jesus. This bush league psych out stuff. Laughable, man  HA HA! I would have fucked you in the ass Saturday. I fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead. Wooo! You got a date Wednesday, baby!"
184,Jesus Quintana,"You ready to be fucked, man? I see you rolled your way into the semis. Dios mio, man. Liam and me, we're gonna fuck you up."
185,Jesus Quintana,"Let me tell you something, pendejo. You pull any of your crazy shit with us, you flash a piece out on the lanes, I'll take it away from you, stick it up your ass and pull the fucking trigger 'til it goes ""click."""
186,Jesus Quintana,"You said it, man. Nobody fucks with the Jesus."
187,Stranger,"And even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes there's a man. Well, I lost m'train of thought here."
188,Walter Sobchak,"And let's also not forget, Dude, that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city,  that isn't legal either."
189,Walter Sobchak,"And so, Theodore Donald Karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean, which you loved so well. Goodnight, sweet prince."
190,The Dude,"And then I uh, ever hear of the Seattle Seven? That was me. And six other guys. And then, music business briefly. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour. Bunch of assholes. And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's slowed down a little lately"
191,Big Lebowski,"And with Brandt as my witness, I'll tell you this"
192,Bunny Lebowski,Brandt can't watch though. Or he has to pay a hundred.
193,The Dude,Brother Shamus? Like an Irish monk?
194,Donny,Burkhalter.
195,Walter Sobchak,Calmer than you are.
196,Walter Sobchak,"Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration! Are you gonna split hairs? Am I wrong?"
197,The Stranger,Darkness warshed over the Dude. Darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night. There was no bottom.
198,Bunny Lebowski,Dieter doesn't care about anything. He's a nihilist.
199,The Dude,"Different mothers, huh? So, racially he's pretty cool."
200,Walter Sobchak,"Donny was a good bowler, and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern California from Redondo to Calabassos. And he was an avid bowler. And a good friend. He died as so many of his generation, before his time. In your wisdom you took him, Lord. As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc and Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And Donny too. Donny who loved bowling."
201,Walter Sobchak,"Fair! Who's the fucking nihilist here! What are you, a bunch of fucking crybabies?!"
202,Walter Sobchak,"Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude. The bulk of the series. Not exactly a lightweight. And yet his son is a fucking dunce."
203,Brandt,Ha-ha-ha-ha! That's marvelous.
204,Brandt,Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Wonderful woman. Very free-spirited. We're all very fond of her.
205,Brandt,"He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug. And you're in a unique position to confirm or disconfirm that suspicion."
206,Big Lebowski,Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Ingles? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
207,The Dude,"Hey, at least I'm housebroken."
208,The Dude,"I, the royal we, you know, the editorial"
209,Big Lebowski,"I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs. Some Chinaman took them from me in Korea. But I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can."
210,Walter Sobchak,I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas!
211,Walter Sobchak,"I'm perfectly calm, Dude."
212,The Dude,"I'm sorry, I wasn't listening."
213,Walter Sobchak,I'm staying. I'm finishing my coffee. Enjoying my coffee.
214,Big Lebowski,Is it being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?
215,The Dude,"It's, uh, it's down there somewhere. Let me take another look."
216,The Dude,"I've got information, man! New shit has come to light!"
217,Walter Sobchak,Just because we're bereaved doesn't make us saps!
218,Maude,Knox Harrington. The video artist.
219,Cop,"Leads, yeah. I'll just check with the boys down at the crime lab. They've assigned four more detectives to the case. They've got us working in shifts!"
220,Walter Sobchak,"Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker. This guy fucking walks. I've never been more certain of anything in my life!"
221,Walter Sobchak,"Mark that frame an eight, and you're entering a world of pain."
222,Fred,"Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski with the Southern Cal Bowling League. I just got an informal report that a member of your team, a Walter Sobchak, drew a FIREARM during league play."
223,Sheriff,"Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski. You don't draw shit. We got a nice, quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet. So let me make something plain. I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski. I don't like your jerk-off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk-off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-off. Do I make myself clear?"
224,Big Lebowski,Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party. That you were drunk and abusive.
225,The Dude,"Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man."
226,Maude,"In a sense, yes. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina."
227,Walter Sobchak,"Nihilists. Fuck me. Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude, at least it's an ethos."
228,Walter Sobchak,"No, they're nihilists, Donny. Nothing to be afraid of."
229,The Dude,NOTHING IS FUCKED?! THE GODDAMN PLANE HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!
230,Walter Sobchak,"Oh, please, dear! For your information, the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!"
231,The Dude,"Oh, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback."
232,The Dude,Okay. The old man told me to take any rug in the house.
233,Walter Sobchak,"Saturday is shabbas, the Jewish day of rest. That means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit DON'T FUCKING ROLL!"
234,Walter Sobchak,Shomer shabbas!
235,Walter Sobchak,"Shut the fuck up, Donny. Whereas what we have here"
236,Waitress at diner,"Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
237,Funeral,"Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house"
238,Walter Sobchak,"Smokey, my friend, you're entering a world of pain."
239,Big Lebowski,"So every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the owner?"
240,Walter Sobchak,So he thinks the carpet-pissers did this?

242,Walter Sobchak,"So you have no frame of reference here, Donny. You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know..."
243,Walter Sobchak,"Some burgers, some beers, a few laughs. Our fucking troubles are over, Dude."
244,Jackie,"Standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude. Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling. People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone."
245,The Dude,That and a pair of testicles.
246,Walter Sobchak,"That's fuckin' combat. The man in the black pajamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary."
247,Walter Sobchak,That's right Dude. They peed on your fucking rug.
248,Walter Sobchak,"The Chinaman is not the issue here, Dude! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line you do not,  and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please."
249,The Dude,"There is an unspoken message here, it's FUCK YOU, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE! ... Yeah, I'll be at practice."
250,The Stranger,"They call Los Angeles the City of Angels. I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says."
251,The Dude,They finally did it. They killed my fucking car.
252,Donny,"They were Nazis, Dude?"
253,The Dude,"This is a very complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs, lotta what-have-yous. It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs. Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber."
254,Walter Sobchak,This is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.
255,Walter Sobchak,"Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax, YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I'M LIVING IN THE PAST!"
256,Kidnapper,"Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski! Nossing!"
257,The Dude,"Walter, this is not a First Amendment thing, man."
258,Walter Sobchak,"We can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan."
259,The Dude,"Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug."
260,The Dude,"What are you, a fucking park ranger now? Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot?"
261,Walter Sobchak,"What do you mean ""brought it bowling""? I didn't rent it fucking shoes. I'm not buying it a fucking beer. He's not taking your fucking turn, Dude."
262,The Dude,"Yeah, man, it really tied the room together."
263,The Dude,"Yeah, that's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious. It's a Swiss fucking watch."
264,The Dude,Yeah? Waving the fucking gun around?!
265,Walter Sobchak,Yeah? What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish?
266,Funeral,"Yes, sir. It is our most modestly priced receptacle."
267,Walter Sobchak,"You want a toe? I can get you a toe. Believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me. Hell, I could get you a toe by 3 o'clock this afternoon, with nail polish."
268,Maude,"You will receive no bill. He's a good man, and thorough."
269,Big Lebowski,"Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski! Condolences! The bums lost! My advice is, do what your parents did! Get a job, sir! The bums will always lose, do you hear me, Lebowski? THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS LOSE!"
